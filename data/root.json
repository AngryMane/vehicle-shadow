Level 5 and 4 ADS (Automated driving system) disengage, if appropriate, only after it achieves a minimal risk condition or a driver is performing the DDT. Level 3 ADS disengages either an appropriate time after issuing a request to intervene or immediately upon user request. Level 2 DAS (Driving automation system) disengages immediately upon driver request. However, since many Level 2 DAS, often termed \"Level 2.5\", warn the driver shortly before reaching their operational limits, the VSS also supports the DISENGAGING state for SAE_2. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the SAE J3016 states that it is incorrect to describe driving automation features using fractional levels.",
